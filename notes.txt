# cell line IDs across first row 

# apply supervised learning approach -> KNN classifier to predict drug sensitivity
# this is for panel of cell lines based on sample

# data is from Drug Sensitivity Prediction Challenge

# Cell lines derived from set of breast tumors OR normal tissue 
# each cell line exposed independently to five drugs 
# GI50 was measured 
# GI50 -> represents drug concentration at which growth is prevented by 50 percent
# GI50 values have been log10 transformed -> higher values reflect greater sensitivity 

# Drug sensitivity values have been binarized 
# "1" corresponds to drug-sensitive cell line 
# "0" corresponds to drug-resistant cell line 

# Goal: Build KNN classifier that predicts which cell lines are sensitive to each drug 

# Drug sensitivity & sample expression data into single text file 

# Drug sensitivity data is 2nd to 6th row. 
# first column is drug name and rest of columns are drug sensitivity values
# "NA" values -> missing values -> drug sens. not measured well

# sample expression data
# first column is sample name 
# rest of columns are sample-level summaries (already transformed and normalized) accross breast cancer cell lines
